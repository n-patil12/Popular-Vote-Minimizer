# Popular-Vote-Minimizer

Date: October 10th, 2023

Project Description: Developed within CS 211, Programming Practicum, this project aims to take a look more into the US voting system, particularly the way that electoral votes are calculated in correlation with the number of popular votes. This project places emphasis on file-reading and writing, as well as both slow and fast recursion with memoization.
